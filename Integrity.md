🛡️ Ariya Transaction Integrity & Off-Platform Policy
Overview
To ensure trust, safety, and quality for everyone using Ariya, all interactions between clients (event planners/hosts) and vendors (event professionals) must occur within the Ariya platform. This includes messaging, negotiation, and payments. Taking transactions off-platform undermines the ecosystem and puts both parties at risk.
Ariya follows a model similar to trusted platforms like Upwork to maintain integrity and protect users.

🚫 Off-Platform Policy
Users must not:
Exchange personal contact information before a confirmed booking.


Suggest or request communication through WhatsApp, email, Telegram, phone calls, or any external tools.


Propose or accept payments outside Ariya.


Share bank details, account numbers, or crypto wallet addresses.


Violating these rules may result in account suspension or permanent ban, and loss of access to funds, profile visibility, or Ariya perks.

🔍 Enforcement & Monitoring
🔹 1. Automated Message Scanning
Ariya uses AI-driven filters to monitor chats for:
Keywords: “WhatsApp,” “send me your number,” “outside Ariya,” “bank transfer,” “pay directly,” “Gmail,” etc.


Obfuscated attempts (e.g., “tim[at]email[dot]com”)


⚠️ Users may receive automated warnings, chat restrictions, or be escalated for manual review.
🔹 2. Reporting & Community Moderation
Users can flag messages or profiles that show suspicious off-platform behavior.


Reports are reviewed by our Trust & Safety team within 24 hours.



🔒 Why It Matters
Payment Protection
 Payments made through Ariya are held securely in escrow and only released when the service is completed satisfactorily.


Dispute Resolution
 In case of issues, Ariya offers mediation and fair resolution processes — only available if the deal happened on-platform.


Vendor Reputation & Visibility
 Off-platform deals mean vendors lose the ability to:


Collect ratings & reviews


Earn badges (e.g., Top Vendor)


Show up in premium searches or promotions


Platform Sustainability
 Our service fees fund platform improvements, customer support, marketing for vendors, and security infrastructure.



✅ How to Stay Compliant
Use Ariya Chat for all discussions before booking.


Share portfolios via uploaded files or Ariya profile links.


Accept and make payments only through Ariya’s secure payment system.


Use Ariya video or voice calls (if applicable) for pre-event consultations.



📣 First-Time Warning
We understand mistakes happen. First-time offenders may receive:
A formal warning and educational content.


Temporary feature restrictions (e.g., messaging lock).


Repeat offenses may result in permanent account removal.

🤝 Protecting Our Community
We are committed to building a safe, transparent, and professional environment where hosts find trusted vendors and vendors get paid reliably for excellent service. By keeping transactions on Ariya, you're helping grow a platform built on fairness and trust.
